# Use the following shell commands to start "demo-drupal" on
# AWS. Change the instance type, region, and vpc-id as needed.  In
# particular, you'll need to use a VPC within your own AWS account.

# Set up your AWS credentials.  See
# https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/aws/

# Create the Docker host, with machine (instance) named "demo-drupal"
docker-machine create -d amazonec2 --amazonec2-instance-type t2.small --amazonec2-region us-east-2 --amazonec2-vpc-id vpc-f9effa91 --amazonec2-security-group demo-drupal demo-drupal

# Allow host creation to complete. Use this command to see how to
# switch your Docker host.
docker-machine env demo-drupal

# Then switch your Docker host.
eval $(docker-machine env demo-drupal)

# In the AWS console, open port 8080 in the "demo-drupal" security
# group so you can reach Drupal.

# Start Drupal.  Use control-C to stop the containers.  Add "-d" if
# you want the containers to detach.
docker-compose up

# If you'd like to SSH into the host (for instance, to mount an EBS
# volume or something), use this command.
docker-machine ssh demo-drupal
